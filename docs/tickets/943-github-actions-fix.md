# Ticket #943: GitHub Actions Build Fix

## Status: âœ… Done
## Priority: ðŸ”´ Critical

## Decision Log References
- DEC008 - Add package.json for CI/CD compatibility
- DEC009 - Critical fixes directly on main branch

## Description
Fix GitHub Actions build errors by adding required npm configuration files.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create package.json with build scripts
- [ ] Generate package-lock.json
- [ ] Ensure CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Maintain Rust as primary build system

## Implementation
1. Add minimal package.json pointing to Rust build
2. Install dependencies to generate lock file
3. Update .github/workflows if needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions runs without errors
- [ ] Dependencies lock file found
- [ ] Build completes successfully

## Notes
Even though ReedSTYLE is a Rust project, GitHub Actions requires npm lock files for dependency scanning.
