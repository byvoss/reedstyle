# ReedSTYLE Color Configuration
# All colors are automatically converted to OKLCH internally
# You can use hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, or oklch format

# Brand Colors (brand-a through brand-f)
colors:
  brand-a: "#FF6B6B"           # Will be converted to OKLCH
  brand-b: "rgb(78, 205, 196)" # Will be converted to OKLCH  
  brand-c: "hsl(200, 70%, 50%)" # Will be converted to OKLCH
  brand-d: "oklch(70% 0.15 120)" # Already in OKLCH
  brand-e: "#FFE66D"
  brand-f: "#A8E6CF"

# Semantic Colors (state colors)
semantic:
  state-success: "#4CAF50"
  state-warning: "#FF9800"
  state-error: "#F44336"
  state-info: "#2196F3"

# Note: Neutral colors (neutral-1 to neutral-9) are automatically provided
# You don't need to define them unless you want custom grays

# Each color automatically generates a 1-9 scale:
# brand-a-1 (lightest) through brand-a-9 (darkest)
# You can use just "brand-a" or access variants like "brand-a-2"

# The 1-9 scale is generated automatically with perceptually uniform steps
# Scale adjusts both lightness and chroma for optimal appearance
