DEC006,2025-08-19T14:45:00Z,Project Structure,Tickets moved to docs/tickets/ separate from docs/develop/,,Better organization and separation of concerns
DEC007,2025-08-19T14:55:00Z,Color System,ALL colors internally stored and processed as OKLCH,DEC002,Better color manipulation and consistency
DEC008,2025-08-19T15:10:00Z,Dependencies,Add package.json for GitHub Actions compatibility,,CI/CD needs npm lock file even for Rust project
DEC009,2025-08-19T15:12:00Z,Git Workflow,Critical fixes directly on main branch allowed,,Hotfixes for broken CI/CD can skip feature branches
DEC010,2025-08-19T15:15:00Z,Git History,Hotfixes must be squashed to single commit,DEC009,Keep main branch history clean - no intermediate commits
DEC011,2025-08-19T15:25:00Z,Development Process,Create implementation plan file for each ticket,,Session recovery and systematic approach - saves context
DEC012,2025-08-19T16:45:00Z,Typography Unicode,Use named constants for all Unicode characters in Rust,,Better readability and maintainability than Unicode escapes
